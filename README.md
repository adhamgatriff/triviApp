# TriviApp

## Introduction
This is a application to test your knowledge in different areas, made with React native using Flow types.

## How to run

``` bash

npm install

react-native run-android

```

## Disclamer
  * I had to add useless constructors to make react-test-renderer work.
  * It only works on android because I do not have ios to configure the dependencies.
  * Tested only in android 7.0.
